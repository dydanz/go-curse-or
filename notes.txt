To design a scalable and adaptive loyalty points platform that can cater to multiple clients (merchants) 
with varying transaction models, you need a robust system architecture, well-defined database schema, 
and modular services. Below is a **technical specification** for your loyalty point platform, 
inspired by best practices and platforms like **Open Loyalty**.

---

### **1. Product Layer Overview**
The system should be divided into the following layers:
1. **Core Loyalty Engine**: Handles point calculations, rewards, and redemption logic.
2. **Merchant Integration Layer**: Allows merchants to define their transaction models and decision tables.
3. **Data Tracking Layer**: Captures and stores customer and transaction data.
4. **Reporting and Analytics Layer**: Provides insights into customer behavior and loyalty program performance.
5. **API Gateway**: Exposes RESTful APIs for merchants and clients to interact with the system.

---

Creating a **decision table** for a store's **historical discount sale** involves defining rules that determine how loyalty points are awarded based on past purchase behavior, such as discounts applied, purchase frequency, or total spending. Below is a step-by-step guide to designing and implementing such a decision table.

---

### **1. Define the Objective**
The goal is to reward customers based on their historical discount purchases at the store. For example:
- Customers who frequently purchase discounted items.
- Customers who spend a significant amount during discount sales.
- Customers who buy specific discounted product categories.

---

### **2. Identify Key Parameters**
To create the decision table, identify the parameters that will influence point calculations:
- **Transaction Amount**: Total spending during discount sales.
- **Discount Percentage**: The discount applied to the purchase.
- **Purchase Frequency**: Number of transactions during discount periods.
- **Item Category**: Specific product categories purchased at a discount.
- **Membership Tier**: Customer's loyalty tier (e.g., Silver, Gold, Platinum).

---

### **3. Define Rules**
Based on the parameters, define rules for awarding points. Here are some examples:

#### **Rule 1: Reward based on total spending during discount sales**
- Condition: `transaction_amount > 100` (spent more than $100 during discount sales).
- Action: Award `10 points per $10 spent`.

#### **Rule 2: Reward based on discount percentage**
- Condition: `discount_percentage >= 20%` (purchased items with at least 20% discount).
- Action: Award `5x points` on the transaction amount.

#### **Rule 3: Reward frequent shoppers during discount sales**
- Condition: `purchase_frequency >= 5` (made 5 or more purchases during discount periods).
- Action: Award `500 bonus points`.

#### **Rule 4: Reward specific product categories**
- Condition: `item_category = "Electronics"` (purchased electronics at a discount).
- Action: Award `20x points` on the transaction amount.

#### **Rule 5: Reward based on membership tier**
- Condition: `membership_tier = "Gold"` (Gold-tier customers).
- Action: Award `2x points` on all discount purchases.

---

### **4. Create the Decision Table**
The decision table maps conditions to actions. Below is an example:

| **Rule ID** | **Condition**                                                                 | **Action**                                      |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1           | `transaction_amount > 100`                                                   | Award `10 points per $10 spent`.               |
| 2           | `discount_percentage >= 20%`                                                 | Award `5x points` on transaction amount.       |
| 3           | `purchase_frequency >= 5`                                                    | Award `500 bonus points`.                      |
| 4           | `item_category = "Electronics"`                                              | Award `20x points` on transaction amount.      |
| 5           | `membership_tier = "Gold"`                                                   | Award `2x points` on all discount purchases.   |

---

### **5. Example Input Data**
Here’s how the store would send transaction data to the loyalty platform for evaluation against the decision table:

#### **Example 1: High Spending During Discount Sale**
```json
{
  "merchant_id": "store_123",
  "customer_id": "cust_456",
  "transaction_amount": 150, // $150 spent
  "discount_percentage": 15, // 15% discount
  "item_category": "General", // General purchase
  "purchase_frequency": 3, // 3 purchases during discount period
  "membership_tier": "Silver", // Silver-tier customer
  "transaction_date": "2023-10-15T12:34:56Z"
}
```

**Processing:**
- Rule 1: `transaction_amount > 100` → Award `10 points per $10 spent` → `150 / 10 * 10 = 150 points`.
- Total Points Awarded: **150 points**.

---

#### **Example 2: Frequent Shopper with High Discount**
```json
{
  "merchant_id": "store_123",
  "customer_id": "cust_789",
  "transaction_amount": 200, // $200 spent
  "discount_percentage": 25, // 25% discount
  "item_category": "Electronics", // Electronics purchase
  "purchase_frequency": 6, // 6 purchases during discount period
  "membership_tier": "Gold", // Gold-tier customer
  "transaction_date": "2023-10-16T18:00:00Z"
}
```

**Processing:**
- Rule 1: `transaction_amount > 100` → Award `10 points per $10 spent` → `200 / 10 * 10 = 200 points`.
- Rule 2: `discount_percentage >= 20%` → Award `5x points` → `5 * 200 = 1000 points`.
- Rule 3: `purchase_frequency >= 5` → Award `500 bonus points`.
- Rule 4: `item_category = "Electronics"` → Award `20x points` → `20 * 200 = 4000 points`.
- Rule 5: `membership_tier = "Gold"` → Award `2x points` → `2 * (200 + 1000 + 500 + 4000) = 11,400 points`.
- Total Points Awarded: **11,400 points**.

---

### **6. Database Schema for Decision Table**
To store the decision table in the database, you can use the following schema:

#### **Decision Table**
| **Column Name**      | **Data Type** | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `decision_table_id`   | UUID          | Unique ID for the decision table.                                              |
| `merchant_id`         | UUID          | Foreign key to the merchant.                                                   |
| `rule_name`           | String        | Name of the rule (e.g., "High Spending Reward").                               |
| `condition_type`      | String        | Type of condition (e.g., `transaction_amount`, `discount_percentage`).         |
| `condition_operator`  | String        | Operator for the condition (e.g., `>`, `>=`, `==`).                            |
| `condition_value`     | String        | Value for the condition (e.g., `100`, `20%`, `Electronics`).                   |
| `action_type`         | String        | Type of action (e.g., `award_points`, `bonus_points`).                         |
| `action_value`        | String        | Value for the action (e.g., `10 points per $10`, `5x points`).                 |
| `created_at`          | Timestamp     | Timestamp when the rule was created.                                           |
| `updated_at`          | Timestamp     | Timestamp when the rule was last updated.                                      |

---

### **7. Implementation Steps**
1. **Merchant Configuration:**
   - Allow the store to define and update decision rules via a dashboard or API.
   - Store the rules in the `Decision Table` database.

2. **Transaction Processing:**
   - Evaluate each transaction against the decision table.
   - Apply all matching rules to calculate points.

3. **Reporting:**
   - Provide the store with insights into how customers are earning points during discount sales.

---

### **8. Example API Payload for Decision Table Creation**
Here’s how the store might create a new rule via an API:

```json
{
  "merchant_id": "store_123",
  "rule_name": "High Spending Reward",
  "condition_type": "transaction_amount",
  "condition_operator": ">",
  "condition_value": "100",
  "action_type": "award_points",
  "action_value": "10 points per $10"
}
```

---

By following this approach, you can create a flexible and adaptive decision table that rewards customers based on 
their historical discount purchases at the store. This system can be easily extended to include additional rules or parameters as needed.
