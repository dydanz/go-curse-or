To design a scalable and adaptive loyalty points platform that can cater to multiple clients (merchants) 
with varying transaction models, you need a robust system architecture, well-defined database schema, 
and modular services. Below is a **technical specification** for your loyalty point platform, 
inspired by best practices and platforms like **Open Loyalty**.

---

### **1. Product Layer Overview**
The system should be divided into the following layers:
1. **Core Loyalty Engine**: Handles point calculations, rewards, and redemption logic.
2. **Merchant Integration Layer**: Allows merchants to define their transaction models and decision tables.
3. **Data Tracking Layer**: Captures and stores customer and transaction data.
4. **Reporting and Analytics Layer**: Provides insights into customer behavior and loyalty program performance.
5. **API Gateway**: Exposes RESTful APIs for merchants and clients to interact with the system.

### **2. Database Schema**
The database should be designed to support multiple merchants, flexible transaction models, and customer data tracking. 
Below are the key tables:

#### **2.1 Core Tables**
- **Merchants**
  - `merchant_id` (PK)
  - `merchant_name`
  - `merchant_type` (e.g., bank, e-commerce, repair shop)
  - `created_at`
  - `updated_at`

- **Customers**
  - `customer_id` (PK)
  - `phone_number` (unique)
  - `email`
  - `full_name`
  - `created_at`
  - `updated_at`

- **Loyalty Programs**
  - `program_id` (PK)
  - `merchant_id` (FK to Merchants)
  - `program_name`
  - `point_currency_name` (e.g., "Points", "Coins")
  - `created_at`
  - `updated_at`

- **Transactions**
  - `transaction_id` (PK)
  - `merchant_id` (FK to Merchants)
  - `customer_id` (FK to Customers)
  - `transaction_type` (e.g., purchase, refund, bonus)
  - `transaction_amount`
  - `transaction_date`
  - `branch_id` (FK to Merchant Branches, if applicable)
  - `created_at`

- **Points Ledger**
  - `ledger_id` (PK)
  - `customer_id` (FK to Customers)
  - `program_id` (FK to Loyalty Programs)
  - `points_earned`
  - `points_redeemed`
  - `points_balance`
  - `transaction_id` (FK to Transactions)
  - `created_at`

#### **2.2 Merchant-Specific Tables**
- **Merchant Branches** (if applicable)
  - `branch_id` (PK)
  - `merchant_id` (FK to Merchants)
  - `branch_name`
  - `branch_location`
  - `created_at`

- **Decision Tables**
  - `decision_table_id` (PK)
  - `merchant_id` (FK to Merchants)
  - `rule_name` (e.g., "High-Value Purchase", "Frequent Shopper")
  - `condition_type` (e.g., "transaction_amount", "item_category")
  - `condition_value` (e.g., ">100", "Motorcycle Parts")
  - `points_awarded`
  - `created_at`
  - `updated_at`

- **Item Categories** (if applicable)
  - `category_id` (PK)
  - `merchant_id` (FK to Merchants)
  - `category_name` (e.g., "Electronics", "Motorcycle Parts")
  - `created_at`

### **3. Services to Create**
To support the above functionality, you need the following services:

#### **3.1 Core Services**
- **Customer Service**
  - Manage customer profiles (create, update, retrieve).
  - Link customers to multiple merchants.

- **Transaction Service**
  - Record transactions from merchants.
  - Validate transactions against merchant-specific rules.

- **Loyalty Engine Service**
  - Calculate points based on merchant decision tables.
  - Update the Points Ledger.
  - Handle point redemption requests.

- **Decision Table Service**
  - Allow merchants to define and manage decision tables.
  - Validate conditions and apply rules during transaction processing.

#### **3.2 Integration Services**
- **Merchant Onboarding Service**
  - Register new merchants and configure their loyalty programs.
  - Set up default decision tables for new merchants.

- **API Gateway**
  - Expose RESTful APIs for:
    - Transaction submission.
    - Customer profile management.
    - Points balance inquiry.
    - Redemption requests.

#### **3.3 Analytics and Reporting Services**
- **Reporting Service**
  - Generate reports for merchants (e.g., customer activity, points earned/redeemed).
  - Provide insights into loyalty program performance.

- **Audit Service**
  - Track changes to decision tables and loyalty programs.
  - Log all transactions and point adjustments for accountability.

### **4. Key Features**
- **Flexible Decision Tables**
  - Merchants can define rules based on:
    - Transaction amount (e.g., "Award 10 points for every $100 spent").
    - Item category (e.g., "Award 50 points for Motorcycle Parts").
    - Transaction frequency (e.g., "Award 100 points for 5 transactions in a month").
    - Membership tier (e.g., "Gold members earn 2x points").

- **Multi-Tenancy Support**
  - Each merchant has isolated data and configurations.
  - Shared core services with merchant-specific customizations.

- **Real-Time Point Calculation**
  - Points are calculated and updated in real-time during transaction processing.

- **Scalability**
  - Use microservices architecture for scalability.
  - Database sharding for large-scale merchants.

---

### **5. Best Practices**
- **Data Security**
  - Encrypt sensitive customer data (e.g., phone numbers, emails).
  - Use OAuth2 for API authentication and authorization.

- **Scalability**
  - Use horizontal scaling for high transaction volumes.
  - Implement database indexing for faster queries.

- **Auditability**
  - Maintain logs for all transactions and rule changes.
  - Provide merchants with audit trails for their loyalty programs.

- **User Experience**
  - Provide merchants with an intuitive dashboard for managing decision tables.
  - Offer APIs and SDKs for easy integration with merchant systems.

---

### **6. Example Workflow**
1. A customer makes a purchase at a merchant.
2. The merchant sends the transaction details (e.g., `transaction_amount`, `item_category`, `customer_id`) to the **Transaction Service**.
3. The **Loyalty Engine Service** evaluates the transaction against the merchant's decision tables.
4. Points are calculated and updated in the **Points Ledger**.
5. The customer receives a notification (e.g., SMS or email) about the points earned.
